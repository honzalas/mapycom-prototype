## API Key Management

You can create and manage API keys in the [My Account portal](https://developer.mapy.com/rest-api-mapy-cz/api-key/):

- Create separate keys for development and production environments
- Generate different keys for web and mobile versions of your app
- Monitor usage and credit consumption
- Secure your production API keys properly

## Authentication

Include your API key in every request using the `apikey` parameter:

```
https://api.mapy.com/v1/[endpoint]?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&[other_parameters]
```

## First API Call

Test your API key with a simple geocoding request:

```bash
curl "https://api.mapy.com/v1/geocode?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&query=Prague"
```

## Pricing Overview
